# Task-Organiser-MERN

## Introduction
A full stack task organiser created using MongoDB, Express, React, Node, TypeScript and Material UI. It places these tasks into an easy-to-read list that allows you to easily sort and delete.

## How to view:
Due to the nature of connection to my personal mongoDB database, you will have to contact me to place your IP address into the accepted list.

From there:
1. Start two terminal sessions, cd into mern/server in one and mern/client in the other
2. `yarn start` in client, `yarn nodemon server.ts` in the server.
3. If `Successfully connected to mongodb server on port {your port} is demonstrated, the create tasks will be placed in the task list.
